# DeltaBot

DeltaBot is a Python-based application designed to merge multiple text files into a single document and provide a side-by-side comparison interface. This tool is particularly useful for users who need to consolidate information from multiple sources and visually compare content on a Windows platform.

## Features

- **File Merging**: Select multiple text files and merge them into a single document, separated by double newlines for clarity.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Opens a new window displaying the content of each file in its own pane for easy comparison.
- **Simple GUI**: Built with Tkinter, DeltaBot provides a straightforward graphical user interface for selecting files and viewing comparisons.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation

2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

## Usage

2. Click on the "Select Text Files" button to open a file dialog.
3. Select the text files you wish to merge and compare.
4. The application will display the content of each file side-by-side in a new window.
5. You will be prompted to save the merged content as a single text file.
